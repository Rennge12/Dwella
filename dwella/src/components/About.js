      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about learning programming, exploring the latest in tech, and constantly improving my skills.
        When I'm not coding, you’ll find me playing football or engaged in any other sport that keeps me moving.
      </p>
      <p>
        I value communication above all else—whether working on a team or talking to new people, I believe clear and effective
        communication is the key to success.
